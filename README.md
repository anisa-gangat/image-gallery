# image-gallery

This assignment was difficult in the aspects of displaying the images.
MDM web was useful in reading about images tags and ChatGPT had given me a result listing on why the code may have had errors.
I made a few errors in adding '/' without the 'dot.' The solution was to read more on Moodle-Cloud before attempting the workshop.
Lastly I didn't edit 'I' and left it capitalized. A friend related how she tried to use lower age 'i' and it displayed the images.
Things to work with: The click side button. The functioning part at the end needs working on.
I thing reviewing each lesson taking notes might help but also understanding and maybe watching a few videos maybe useful.
I think more time could have been spent on crafting the page however I faced a few technical issues outside of creating this assignment.
Thank you for reading my notes -Anisa Gangat.
